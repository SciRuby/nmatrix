=== 0.0.1 / 2012-04-10

* 1 major enhancement

  * Initial alpha release

=== 0.0.2 / 2012-09-21

* 15 major enhancements

  * Second alpha release

  * Rewrote NMatrix in C++0x and C++11 using templates, namespaces; removed Ruby generators and CAST parser

  * Added preliminary C API

  * Slicing and referencing support for dense and list matrices (by @flipback)

  * BLAS level-3 xTRSM algorithm added for rationals and BLAS types

  * LAPACK support added, including partially working xGETRF subroutine

  * Element-wise comparisons now return byte-matrices

  * Element-wise operations on list matrices may alter the default value of the return matrix

  * Element-wise division behaves like Ruby division

  * Improved MATLAB .MAT v5 file reading

  * clang support

  * `==` operator now used for matrix equality, `=~` and `!~` for element-wise comparisons

  * Dense `each` returns an Enumerator when called without a block

  * Sped up list storage item deletion, fixed bugs

  * List matrix-to-hash conversion with `to_h`

* Note: Element-wise list operations current disabled

=== 0.0.3 / 2013-01-18

* 8 major enhancements

  * Matrix-scalar operations (dense, list)

  * Shortcuts for matrix creation (by @agarie)

  * Access to most ATLAS-implemented LAPACK functions for those with ATLAS' CLAPACK interface: xGETRF, xGETRI, xGETRS, xGESV, xPOTRF, xPOTRI, xPOTRS, xPOSV, xLASWP, xSCAL, xLAUUM

  * Access to additional ATLAS-implemented BLAS functions: xTRMM, xSYRK, xHERK, xROT, xROTG

  * Non-ATLAS versions of CLAPACK functions: xLASWP, xSCAL, xLAUUM, xROT

  * Matrix inversion (LU and Cholesky; requires CLAPACK)

  * LU factoring with and without CLAPACK

  * Native matrix I/O for dense (supporting upper, lower, hermitian, skew, symmetric, and general) and yale (general only); excludes Ruby objects currently

* 2 bug fixes:

  * Yale-to-list casting

  * Now requires packable-1.3.5 or higher, fixing a problem with MATLAB .mat v5 file I/O (specific to doubles)

=== 0.0.4 / 2013-??-??

* 1 major enhancement

  * Added a more user-friendly interface for cblas_rot in the form of NMatrix::BLAS::rot

* 1 minor enhancement

  * Spec clean-up

* 1 bug fix:

  * NMatrix::BLAS::gemv segfaults
